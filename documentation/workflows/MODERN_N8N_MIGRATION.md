# Deprecated: n8n Integration

**Note**: This file is deprecated. AthenAI no longer uses n8n workflows.

AthenAI now uses a native Node.js agent system with:
- Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents
- LangChain integration for AI capabilities
- Direct API integrations without workflow orchestration
- Real-time WebSocket communication
- Knowledge substrate integration

For current architecture information, see the main [README.md](../../README.md).
