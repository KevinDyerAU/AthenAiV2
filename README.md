## Overview

NeoV3 represents the next evolution in AI agent orchestration, implementing a sophisticated operating system where specialized AI agents collaborate through a shared consciousness substrate. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate in isolation, NeoV3 creates a living ecosystem where agents can share knowledge, delegate tasks, and collectively solve complex problems that exceed the capabilities of any individual agent.

The system is built on the principle of **distributed intelligence**, where each agent maintains its specialized expertise while contributing to and benefiting from a collective knowledge base. This approach enables emergent behaviors and solutions that arise from agent collaboration, making the whole system significantly more capable than the sum of its parts.

### Key Capabilities

**Autonomous Agent Orchestration**: The system manages multiple specialized AI agents, each with distinct personalities, capabilities, and areas of expertise. Agents can be dynamically created, configured, and deployed based on workload requirements and task complexity.

**Shared Consciousness Substrate**: A Neo4j-based knowledge graph serves as the central nervous system, storing not just data but the relationships, context, and reasoning patterns that emerge from agent interactions. This substrate enables sophisticated knowledge discovery and cross-pollination of ideas between agents.

**Real-time Collaboration**: Through WebSocket connections and RabbitMQ message queuing, agents can communicate in real-time, share intermediate results, and coordinate complex multi-step workflows without human intervention.

**Adaptive Learning**: The system continuously learns from agent interactions, user feedback, and task outcomes, refining its approaches and expanding its knowledge base through reinforcement learning and human feedback loops.

**Enterprise Integration**: Built with enterprise requirements in mind, including comprehensive monitoring, audit trails, security controls, and scalable deployment options for both cloud and on-premises environments.

**LangSmith Observability**: Integrated with LangSmith for comprehensive AI workflow tracing, performance monitoring, and debugging capabilities across all agent interactions and n8n workflows.

## System Architecture

The NeoV3 architecture implements a layered approach that separates concerns while enabling seamless integration between components. The system is designed for high availability, scalability, and maintainability.

### Architectural Principles

**Microservices Architecture**: Each major component runs as an independent service, enabling independent scaling, deployment, and maintenance. Services communicate through well-defined APIs and message queues.

**Event-Driven Communication**: The system uses event-driven patterns for loose coupling between components. Agents publish events to message queues, and interested parties subscribe to relevant event types.

**Stateless Design**: Core services are designed to be stateless, with all persistent state stored in dedicated databases. This enables horizontal scaling and simplifies deployment management.

**Fault Tolerance**: The system implements circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation to handle component failures without cascading system-wide outages.

**Security by Design**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging are built into every layer of the system, with role-based access controls and comprehensive security monitoring.

## Core Components

### API Gateway and Service Layer

The API gateway serves as the primary entry point for all external interactions with the NeoV3 system. Built using Flask-RESTX, it provides comprehensive REST endpoints with automatic OpenAPI documentation generation.

**Authentication and Authorization**: The system implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access controls. Users can be assigned different permission levels, from read-only access to full administrative privileges.

**Request Routing**: The gateway intelligently routes requests to appropriate backend services, handling load balancing, circuit breaking, and retry logic automatically.

**Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse and ensures fair resource allocation across users and applications.

**Audit Logging**: Every API request is logged with comprehensive metadata, enabling detailed security audits and usage analytics.

### WebSocket Communication Layer

Real-time communication is handled through a sophisticated WebSocket implementation that enables bidirectional communication between the user interface and the agent ecosystem.

**Room-based Communication**: WebSocket connections are organized into rooms, typically corresponding to conversation contexts or project workspaces. This enables targeted message delivery and context preservation.

**Agent Status Broadcasting**: Real-time updates about agent status, task progress, and system health are broadcast to connected clients, providing immediate feedback on system operations.

**Message Queuing Integration**: WebSocket messages are integrated with the RabbitMQ message queuing system, ensuring reliable delivery and enabling complex routing patterns.

### Document Processing Pipeline

The document processing pipeline leverages Unstructured.io to handle a wide variety of document formats, extracting structured information and making it available to the agent ecosystem.

**Multi-format Support**: The system can process PDFs, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, HTML files, images, and many other formats, extracting text, metadata, and structural information.

**Intelligent Chunking**: Large documents are intelligently chunked to optimize processing and storage while preserving semantic coherence.

**Vector Embedding Generation**: Processed content is automatically converted to vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding models, enabling semantic search and similarity matching.

**Knowledge Graph Integration**: Extracted information is automatically integrated into the Neo4j knowledge graph, creating relationships and enabling graph-based reasoning.

## Agent Ecosystem

The NeoV3 agent ecosystem consists of specialized AI agents, each designed for specific types of tasks and equipped with unique capabilities and personalities.

### Agent Specializations

**Main Coordinator Agent**: Serves as the primary interface between users and the agent ecosystem. It understands user intent, delegates tasks to appropriate specialized agents, and synthesizes responses from multiple agents into coherent outputs. The coordinator maintains conversation context and ensures that user requests are handled efficiently.

**Research Agent**: Specializes in information gathering, web research, and fact verification. It can access external APIs, search databases, and cross-reference information from multiple sources. The research agent is particularly skilled at finding relevant information quickly and assessing source credibility.

**Analysis Agent**: Focuses on data processing, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition. It can work with structured and unstructured data, perform complex calculations, and generate insights from large datasets. The analysis agent excels at identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies in data.

**Creative Agent**: Handles content creation, ideation, and design thinking tasks. It can generate written content, brainstorm ideas, create visual concepts, and approach problems from innovative angles. The creative agent brings artistic and imaginative capabilities to the system.

**Technical Agent**: Specializes in code generation, system architecture, and technical problem-solving. It can write code in multiple programming languages, design system architectures, and provide technical solutions to complex problems. The technical agent stays current with best practices and emerging technologies.

**Project Manager Agent**: Orchestrates complex multi-step projects by breaking them down into manageable tasks, allocating resources, and managing timelines. It coordinates between other agents and ensures that projects stay on track and meet their objectives.

**Triage Agent**: Handles issue prioritization, emergency response, and resource routing. It can quickly assess the severity of problems, escalate critical issues, and ensure that urgent matters receive immediate attention.

**Maintenance Agent**: Monitors system health, performs preventive maintenance, and optimizes performance. It proactively identifies potential issues and takes corrective action to maintain system reliability and efficiency.

### Agent Communication Patterns

Agents communicate through several mechanisms, each optimized for different types of interactions:

**Direct Messaging**: For immediate, synchronous communication between agents working on the same task.

**Event Broadcasting**: For notifying multiple agents about state changes or important events.

**Knowledge Sharing**: Through the consciousness substrate, agents can share insights, findings, and learned patterns.

**Task Delegation**: Higher-level agents can delegate specific subtasks to specialized agents, with clear success criteria and deadlines.

## Consciousness Substrate

The consciousness substrate represents the most innovative aspect of NeoV3, implementing a shared knowledge base that enables sophisticated reasoning and knowledge discovery across the agent ecosystem.

```

### Knowledge Representation

The consciousness substrate uses a hybrid approach combining graph-based knowledge representation with vector embeddings to capture both explicit relationships and semantic similarities.

**Entity-Relationship Model**: Core knowledge is represented as entities (concepts, facts, insights) connected by typed relationships. This enables precise querying and logical reasoning about stored information.

**Vector Embeddings**: All textual content is converted to high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art embedding models. This enables semantic search, similarity matching, and clustering of related concepts.

**Contextual Annotations**: Knowledge entities are annotated with contextual information including source, confidence level, temporal validity, and relevance scores.

**Provenance Tracking**: Every piece of information includes complete provenance tracking, showing how it was derived, what sources contributed to it, and how it has evolved over time.

### Reasoning Capabilities

The substrate implements several reasoning mechanisms that enable sophisticated knowledge discovery and insight generation:

**Graph Traversal**: Complex queries can traverse multiple relationship types to discover indirect connections and derive new insights from existing knowledge.

**Semantic Inference**: Vector similarity operations enable the system to find conceptually related information even when explicit relationships don't exist.

**Pattern Recognition**: Machine learning algorithms continuously analyze the knowledge graph to identify recurring patterns, trends, and anomalies.

**Contradiction Detection**: The system can identify conflicting information and flag it for resolution, maintaining knowledge consistency.

**Confidence Propagation**: Confidence scores are propagated through reasoning chains, enabling the system to assess the reliability of derived conclusions.

## Installation & Deployment

NeoV3 supports multiple deployment scenarios, from local development environments to enterprise-scale cloud deployments. The system is designed to be cloud-native while maintaining compatibility with on-premises infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

**System Requirements**:
- Docker 20.10+ with Docker Compose
- Python 3.10+ for development and scripting
- Node.js 18+ for workflow management and UI components
- Minimum 16GB RAM for local development
- 50GB+ available disk space for databases and logs

**External Services**:
- Neo4j 5.x database (can be containerized or managed service)
- PostgreSQL 13+ for relational data storage
- Redis 6+ for caching and session management
- RabbitMQ 3.


8+ for message queuing and event distribution

### Quick Start Deployment

The fastest way to get NeoV3 running is using the provided deployment scripts that handle all dependencies and configuration automatically.

**Local Development Deployment**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/KevinDyerAU/NeoV3.git
cd NeoV3

# Make deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy-local.sh

# Run local deployment
./deploy-local.sh
```

The local deployment script performs the following operations:

1. **Environment Validation**: Checks for required dependencies and system resources
2. **Container Orchestration**: Starts all required services using Docker Compose
3. **Database Initialization**: Creates schemas and applies migrations for PostgreSQL and Neo4j
4. **Service Health Checks**: Waits for all services to become healthy before proceeding
5. **Initial Configuration**: Sets up default agent configurations and workflow templates
6. **Monitoring Setup**: Configures Prometheus, Grafana, and logging infrastructure
7. **Validation Testing**: Runs basic connectivity and functionality tests

#### Local Deployment Flow (Detailed)

The local scripts orchestrate the stack in deterministic phases to ensure dependencies are ready before proceeding. The main flow now runs in the following order:

```
phase_core → phase_unstructured → phase_migrations → phase_monitoring → phase_orchestration → phase_workflows → phase_api → run_smoke_tests → summary
```

- `phase_core`: Starts core infrastructure (databases, cache, message queue).
- `phase_unstructured`: Starts Unstructured worker services when enabled.
- `phase_migrations`: Applies database and graph migrations.
- `phase_monitoring`: Brings up Prometheus, Grafana, and related exporters.
- `phase_orchestration`: Starts n8n workflow engine and waits for health.
- `phase_workflows`: Loads and activates n8n workflows via `scripts/load-workflows.sh`. Pulls `N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` from the environment or `.env` (defaults user to `admin`). Skips gracefully if password is not set.
- `phase_api`: Builds and starts the API service, then verifies `/system/health`.
- `run_smoke_tests`: Runs `scripts/testing/smoke-tests.sh` to validate key endpoints and containers (API, Grafana, Prometheus, n8n, Postgres, Neo4j, Redis, RabbitMQ).
- `summary`: Prints a compose and health summary for quick diagnostics.

#### Cross-platform robustness

To improve Windows + macOS/Linux compatibility:

- Scripts like `scripts/load-workflows.sh` and `scripts/testing/smoke-tests.sh` are invoked via `bash` if the file exists, not only if it has the executable bit set. This avoids issues on filesystems that don't preserve UNIX file permissions.
- The PowerShell deployment (`deploy-local.ps1`) mirrors the same phases and calls the same bash helper scripts for workflow loading and smoke tests, sourcing credentials from the environment or `.env`.

#### Post-deploy validation

After the API is healthy, the deployment runs `scripts/testing/smoke-tests.sh` to validate the stack. These checks are lightweight and fail-fast:

- API: `GET /system/health` on `API_HOST_PORT` (defaults to 5000)
- Grafana: `GET /api/health`
- Prometheus: `GET /-/ready`
- n8n: `GET /`
- RabbitMQ management API (if `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER`/`RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS` are available): `GET /api/overview`
- Containers running: `enhanced-ai-postgres`, `enhanced-ai-neo4j`, `enhanced-ai-rabbitmq`, `enhanced-ai-agent-api`
- Postgres: `docker exec enhanced-ai-postgres psql -c 'select 1;'`
- Neo4j: `docker exec enhanced-ai-neo4j cypher-shell 'RETURN 1;'`
- Redis: `docker exec enhanced-ai-redis redis-cli PING`

The script prints a concise OK/WARN/FAIL status for each check and exits non-zero if any checks fail. Failures are logged as warnings by the deployment scripts to avoid interrupting iterative development, but you should investigate and resolve them.

**Cloud Deployment**:

```bash
# Configure cloud environment variables
cp .env.cloud.example .env.cloud
# Edit .env.cloud with your cloud service credentials

# Run cloud deployment
./deploy-cloud.sh
```

### Environment Configuration

NeoV3 uses a comprehensive environment configuration system that supports multiple deployment scenarios. Configuration files are provided for different environments:

- `.env.development.example`: Local development with debug logging
- `.env.staging.example`: Staging environment with production-like settings
- `.env.production.example`: Production deployment with security hardening
- `.env.cloud.example`: Cloud-specific configurations for managed services

**Core Configuration Variables**:

    end

    AUTH --> AGENTS
    AGENTS --> KNOWLEDGE
    KNOWLEDGE --> CONV
    CONV --> WORKFLOWS
    WORKFLOWS --> SYSTEM
    SYSTEM --> INTEGRATIONS
```

### Authentication and Authorization

The API implements JWT-based authentication with role-based access control:

**Authentication Flow**:
1. User submits credentials to `/auth/login`
2. System validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. System validates token and extracts user permissions
5. Endpoints check required permissions before processing requests

**Role Hierarchy**:
- **Administrator**: Full system access, user management, configuration changes
- **Power User**: Agent management, workflow creation, advanced features
- **Standard User**: Basic chat, knowledge access, personal workflows
- **Read-Only**: View-only access to public information and documentation

### WebSocket API

Real-time communication is handled through WebSocket connections with namespace-based organization:

**Connection Namespaces**:
- `/chat`: Real-time chat communication with agents
- `/agents`: Agent status updates and notifications
- `/system`: System health and monitoring events
- `/workflows`: Workflow execution status and results

**Event Types**:
```javascript
// Agent status updates
